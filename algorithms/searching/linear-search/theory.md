## Introduction

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is the simplest searching
algorithm. It checks each element in a collection one by one until it finds
the target or reaches the end.

While not the fastest search algorithm, linear search is incredibly versatile
and often the best choice for specific scenarios.

## Real-World Analogy

### Looking for Your Keys

Imagine you're searching for your car keys in your house. You don't have any
organized system (they're not in a specific drawer or hook). Your approach:

1. Check the kitchen counter
2. Look on the coffee table
3. Search your jacket pockets
4. Check the bedroom dresser
5. Continue until you find them (or check everywhere)

This is exactly how linear search works - checking each location (element)
sequentially until finding what you're looking for.

### Other Real-World Examples

- **Reading a shopping list**: Checking each item one by one
- **Looking for a name on an attendance sheet**: Reading from top to bottom
- **Finding a specific car in a parking lot**: Walking through each row
- **Searching for a word in a paragraph**: Reading word by word

## How Linear Search Works

Linear search follows a straightforward process:

1. Start at the first element
2. Compare it with the target
3. If found, return the position
4. If not, move to the next element
5. Repeat until found or end of collection

### Visual Representation

```
Array: [15, 3, 9, 1, 12, 5, 7]
Target: 12

Step 1: Check 15 (index 0) - Not a match
Step 2: Check 3  (index 1) - Not a match  
Step 3: Check 9  (index 2) - Not a match
Step 4: Check 1  (index 3) - Not a match
Step 5: Check 12 (index 4) - Found it!
```

## The Algorithm

### Basic Implementation (Pseudocode)

```
function linearSearch(array, target):
    for index from 0 to array.length - 1:
        if array[index] equals target:
            return index
    return -1  // Not found
```

### Key Characteristics

1. **No prerequisites**: Works on unsorted data
2. **Sequential access**: Checks elements in order
3. **Early termination**: Stops when target is found
4. **Simple logic**: Just comparison and iteration

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(1) - Target is the first element
- **Average Case**: O(n/2) ≈ O(n) - Target is in the middle
- **Worst Case**: O(n) - Target is last or not present

### Space Complexity

- **O(1)** - Only uses a constant amount of extra space

### Performance Analysis

For an array of size n:

- Minimum comparisons: 1
- Maximum comparisons: n
- Average comparisons: (n+1)/2

## When to Use Linear Search

### Ideal Scenarios

1. **Small datasets** (< 100 elements)
   - Overhead of complex algorithms isn't worth it
   - Simple implementation wins

2. **Unsorted data**
   - Binary search requires sorting
   - Linear search works immediately

3. **Finding multiple occurrences**
   - Need to check all elements anyway
   - Can collect all matches in one pass

4. **Linked lists or sequential access**
   - No random access available
   - Must traverse sequentially

5. **When simplicity matters**
   - Easy to implement correctly
   - No edge cases to worry about

### Real Performance Considerations

```
Array size 10:    Linear often faster than binary
Array size 100:   Linear competitive with binary
Array size 1000:  Binary search typically wins
Array size 10000: Binary search much faster
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

✅ **Simplicity**: Easiest search algorithm to implement
✅ **No sorting required**: Works on any collection
✅ **Works everywhere**: Arrays, linked lists, files
✅ **Finds first occurrence**: In order of appearance
✅ **Cache-friendly**: Sequential memory access
✅ **Predictable**: Always same behavior

### Disadvantages

❌ **Slow for large data**: O(n) can be prohibitive
❌ **Many comparisons**: Checks every element in worst case
❌ **Not scalable**: Performance degrades linearly

## Variations

### 1. Sentinel Linear Search

Add the target to the end to eliminate bounds checking:

```
function sentinelLinearSearch(array, target):
    last = array[n-1]
    array[n-1] = target
    
    i = 0
    while array[i] != target:
        i++
    
    array[n-1] = last
    
    if i < n-1 or array[n-1] == target:
        return i
    return -1
```

### 2. Find All Occurrences

```
function findAll(array, target):
    results = []
    for index from 0 to array.length - 1:
        if array[index] equals target:
            results.add(index)
    return results
```

### 3. Find with Predicate

```
function findIf(array, predicate):
    for index from 0 to array.length - 1:
        if predicate(array[index]):
            return index
    return -1
```

### 4. Reverse Linear Search

Start from the end:

```
function reverseLinearSearch(array, target):
    for index from array.length - 1 down to 0:
        if array[index] equals target:
            return index
    return -1
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Linear search is O(n)** - Time proportional to input size
2. **No sorting required** - Works on any data arrangement
3. **Best for small datasets** - Simplicity often wins
4. **Sequential access pattern** - Good cache performance
5. **Foundation for other algorithms** - Many algorithms use linear search as a subroutine

### When Linear Search is the Right Choice

- Data is unsorted and sorting is expensive
- Dataset is small (< 100 elements)
- You need to find all occurrences
- Simplicity and correctness are priorities
- You're searching a linked list or stream
