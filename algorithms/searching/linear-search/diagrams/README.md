# Linear Search Visual Diagrams

This directory contains visual representations of the linear search algorithm
to help understand how it works.

## Available Diagrams

### 1. Linear Search Process (linear-search-process.png)

Shows step-by-step how linear search checks each element sequentially until
finding the target or reaching the end of the array.

### 2. Linear Search Variations (linear-search-variations.png)

Illustrates different variations:

- Basic linear search (first occurrence)
- Find all occurrences
- Reverse linear search (last occurrence)
- Predicate-based search

### 3. Performance Comparison (linear-vs-others.png)

Visual comparison of linear search performance against other search algorithms
for different array sizes and scenarios.

## How to Use These Diagrams

1. **Study the process diagram first** to understand the basic algorithm
2. **Explore variations** to see how the algorithm can be adapted
3. **Review performance comparison** to understand when to use linear search

## Creating New Diagrams

If you want to create additional diagrams:

1. Use Excalidraw for consistency
2. Follow the style guide in the project root
3. Export as PNG with transparent background
4. Name descriptively (e.g., `linear-search-cache-effects.png`)
